"""Declarative verification-target gate (reflection world, **pluggable module**, issue #13).

In multi-line repos (several independently maintained product lines sharing
one set of gates and one verification environment), verification gates read
"**whichever world happens to be deployed**" — three real incidents
(Octave-Full-Wasm, 2026-10-07):

  1. After cherry-picking a commit onto wasm64-NEXT, a gate went red: NEXT's
     plugin roster was being checked against the site deployed by
     IllegalPerformance — the gate wasn't broken; it faithfully compared the
     world that happened to be deployed in the environment, and that world
     belonged to another line;
  2. The same shape went red again on master: master's verification target
     should be the repo's own site/, not the shared deployed site;
  3. Artifacts rebuilt on NEXT leaked into rust_sort: the shared container
     was running another line's build script (the version with the IP
     table flipped).

Root cause (in seam language): a seam exists, but it is **four parallel
half-seams** — different names, different defaults, different coverage
(some gates read env, some hardcode a container, some read "latest");
nothing forces the gates to align with "this line's world" when switching
lines.

World declaration (**data, not code**, same pattern as #7):

    { "lines": {
        "wasm64-NEXT": { "site": "/…/next-base/site",
                          "artifacts": "/…/next-base/w64-artifacts",
                          "container": "o113",
                          "fork_pin_ref": "upstream/octave" } },
      "active": "wasm64-NEXT",
      "stamps": {
        "container": { "value": "sha256:…",
                        "cmd": "docker inspect --format '{{.Image}}' o113" },
        "site":     { "value": "sha256:…",
                        "cmd": "find /…/site -type f | sort | xargs sha256sum | sha256sum" },
        "scripts":  { "value": "sha256:…",
                        "cmd": "sha256sum relink.sh link-web.sh | sha256sum" } } }

The gate does three things:

  · **Resolve the current line** (unified interface): `REFLECT_WORLD_LINE`
    (override for CI / special run modes) > current branch name (if the
    branch is a line in the roster) > `active` (a human's decision). Other
    gates obtain their verification target via `resolve_line()` — replacing
    four ambient knobs; the gate's deep-module nature is unchanged, what
    gets hidden is "how the world resolves";
  · **Branch audit**: the branch is a line in the roster yet ≠ `active` ⇒ red
    (the shape of incidents 1/2: a human switched branches without running
    the line-switch script, active still points at the other line);
  · **Stamp audit**: each stamp's `cmd` is replayed verbatim (bare-value
    contract — `run_cmd` grafts the replay gate directly), stdout ≠ `value`
    ⇒ red (the shape of incident 3: the container runs another line's
    script, artifacts got contaminated).

**Switching lines = running a script that this gate audits**: after the
script finishes its three steps (submodule update + re-provision + cp
scripts) it **writes out** the world declaration (active + stamps), and
this gate audits declaration vs environment at commit time — turning the
"three-step line switch" from verbal discipline into a witnessed act
(same grafting approach as doctor/witness).

Pluggable: `REFLECT_WORLD` unset and the default `world.json` absent ⇒
state plainly that it is off, return 0. **Single-line repos neither benefit
nor suffer** (one world = the status-quo behavior — a boundary the issue
states explicitly; what this bites is the shape "several independently
maintained lines sharing one verification environment").

Honest boundary (stated in the issue, not hidden):

  · **No automatic line selection is proposed** — which line counts as
    current is a human's decision (the `active` field); the machine only
    ensures declaration and environment agree;
  · Cross-engine reproducibility (relaxed_madd makes BLAS results vary in
    the last digit — IEEE-compliant yet irreproducible) is a separate topic,
    orthogonal to this item's "verifying the wrong world"; don't conflate;
  · A stamp's `cmd` is written by the repo itself — same trust boundary as
    the replay gate (the repo produces it and reviews it itself).

Usage (run directly, cwd=repo root):
    python3 zreflect/check_world.py [--selftest]
Exit codes: 0=green / 1=problems found / 2=configuration or environment broken.
